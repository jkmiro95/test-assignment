# Additional notes
* Test cases can be found in the repository and under [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16BCGuApFsz4idi3WicsySaO5xNJuODdPsAB1Jq1W0sk/edit?usp=sharing) link
* All of the test cases could be automated, I didn't want to spend more time than I should developing them, as other test cases would be quite similar
